          (Cliche Ahead) To be honest, the best thing about this drawing app was
          the journey, not the destination. The final project was pretty cool,
          but it was more fun learning how to create a user interface and how to
          set up certain sensors to make sure bugs don’t occur and all that.
          Anyways, this is the first and most basic version of my drawing app,
          with a few serviceable tools that work pretty darn well.

        <h2>Debate</h2>
        <p>
          Okay, I don’t really have any more things that I’ve “made”, but that’s
          because I’ve been committed to my debate team. I’ve been on the BHS
          debate team since 2022, and I’ve done pretty well at a few
          tournaments. Recently, I placed in the octofinals at an open
          parliamentary debate tournament at berkeley!

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python Summer Homework</p>
        <p>
          I did python over the summer rather than scratch despite having no
          former programming experience, and I don’t regret it at all! I still
          prefer python over scratch, and learning python lets me wrap my head
          around more complicated concepts quicker, like lists, functions, etc.
          Above is the license plate assignment, which was definitely the
          hardest one, and I spent probably an hour and thirty minutes on it,
          but I learned a bunch!
