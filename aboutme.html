      <p>
        I’m a senior at Benicia High School, and god knows that I’ve taken too
        much on my plate throughout the past couple of years. Despite this, I
        still find time to no-life videogames every once in a while, while
        participating (and doing pretty well in) other activities such as debate
        and drama. I plan to go into either psychology or computer science,
        maybe I’ll do both.
